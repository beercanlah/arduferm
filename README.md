Arduferm
========

Arduferm let's you turn your fridge into a controlled environment for
fermenting beer.

Overview
--------

Arduferm is an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) based temperature
controller, that let's you stabilize the temperature in a fridge or
freezer by switching on and off the power to the device. This way the
inside of a fridge can be controlled to a higher temperature then the
fridge itself was designed for. For example, this makes your fridge an
ideal environment for fermenting beer.

The project itself contains two parts. An hardware project that allows
an Arudino to sense temperature and switch power, and a software
project that is uploaded on the Arduino which handles the control of
the fridge.

Background
----------

The project originated as part of the homebrewing effort by Nick Lewty
and Markus Baden. Checkout the
[beercanlah.com](http://www.beercanlah.com) blog to read more about
[the homebrew setup](http://beercanlah.com/?page_id=49). The project
itself is closely related to the
[Ardumashtun project](https://github.com/beercanlah/ardumashtun). In
effect the hardware used is near identical.
